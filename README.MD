## Inspiration
Managing personal finances can be overwhelming, with scattered transactions, unclear spending patterns, and a lack of real-time insights. We wanted to create **a seamless, AI-powered solution** that simplifies expense tracking, provides actionable insights, and helps users **make smarter financial decisions effortlessly**.
